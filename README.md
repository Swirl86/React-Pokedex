# Pokedex - Remake from my school project [school project](https://github.com/Swirl86/Webbutveckling-Kurs/tree/main/pokedex)

I want to learn more react as it's been a while since I coded with react.

From my school days in 2022, I thought that my assignment for Pokemon was really fun and informative.

It will be a perfect time to refactor and further develop my old project and also learn more react.

----------

## A simple and interactive Pokedex application built with React. This project fetches data from an external API to display a list of Pokémon, with detailed information available for each Pokémon. Users can browse and search for Pokémon, making it easy to explore various characters and their attributes.
