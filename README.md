# Pokedex - Remake from my school project [school project](https://github.com/Swirl86/Webbutveckling-Kurs/tree/main/pokedex)

I want to learn more react as it's been a while since I coded with react.

From my school days in 2022, I thought that my assignment for Pokemon was really fun and informative.

It will be a perfect time to refactor and further develop my old project and also learn more react.
